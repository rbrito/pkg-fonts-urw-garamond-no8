                              Aladdin Free Public License
                            (Version 9, September 18, 2000)
    .
         Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 Aladdin Enterprises,
                  Menlo Park, California, U.S.A. All rights reserved.
    .
        NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by
        the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from
        those of the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses,
        please read this license with extra care.
    .
    Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this
    License to their own work, as long as the entire License (including the above
    notices and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or deletions
    except for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable
    description of the work to which the license is being applied and of the person
    or entity that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being
    applied to a work created in a country other than the United States, replacing
    the first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the laws of
    the appropriate country.
    .
    This License is not an Open Source license: among other things, it places
    restrictions on distribution of the Program, specifically including sale of the
    Program. While Aladdin Enterprises respects and supports the philosophy of the
    Open Source Definition, and shares the desire of the GNU project to keep
    licensed software freely redistributable in both source and object form, we
    feel that Open Source licenses unfairly prevent developers of useful software
    from being compensated proportionately when others profit financially from
    their work. This License attempts to ensure that those who receive,
    redistribute, and contribute to the licensed Program according to the Open
    Source and Free Software philosophies have the right to do so, while retaining
    for the developer(s) of the Program the power to make those who use the Program
    to enhance the value of commercial products pay for the privilege of doing so.
    .
    0. Subject Matter
    .
    This License applies to the computer programs known as "AFPL Ghostscript",
    "AFPL Ghostscript PCL5e", "AFPL Ghostscript PCL5c", and "AFPL Ghostscript
    PXL".  The "Program", below, refers to such program. The Program is a
    copyrighted work whose copyright is held by Artifex Software Inc., located in
    San Rafael California and artofcode LLC, located in Benicia, California (the
    "Licensor"). Please note that AFPL Ghostscript is neither the program known as
    "GNU Ghostscript" nor the version of Ghostscript available for commercial
    licensing from Artifex Software Inc.
    .
    A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
    of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as
    a translation or a modification.
    .
    BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM),
    YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND
    CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON
    IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR
    DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY
    LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR
    DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.
    .
    1. Licenses.
    .
    Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply with
    all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further, that
    you distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the Program:
    .
    (a) You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the
        Program's source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any
        medium.
    (b) You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and
        distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.
    .
    2. Restrictions.
    .
    This license is subject to the following restrictions:
    .
    (a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a
        commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is
        made in connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in payment
        for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for some service
        related to the Program, or payment for some product or service that
        includes a copy of the Program "without charge"; these are only examples,
        and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities). The following
        methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be
        a violation of this restriction:
    .
        (i) Posting the Program on a public access information storage and
            retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving
            information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not
            content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the
            same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access
            to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other
            product or service. An example of a service that does not fall under
            this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and
            that is only available to customers of that company. (This is not an
            exhaustive enumeration.)
        (ii)
            Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided
            that the files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and
            verbatim on such media, that all information on such media be
            redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge, and that
            such media are distributed by themselves (except for accompanying
            documentation) independent of any other product or service. Examples of
            such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media.
            (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a
            distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included
            in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)
    .
    (b) Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program
        are not subject to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional
        use (running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output produced
        through the use of the Program is subject to this license only if its
        contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
        made by running the Program).
    (c) You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work that
        you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived
        from the Program or any part thereof ("the Work"):
    .
        (i) If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry
            prominent notices stating that you have modified the Program's files
            and the date of any change. In each source file that you have modified,
            you must include a prominent notice that you have modified the file,
            including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the date and
            purpose of the change;
        (ii)
            You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to
            all third parties under the terms of this License;
        (iii)
            If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must
            cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print or
            display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
            notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
            warranty). Such notice must also state that users may redistribute the
            Work only under the conditions of this License and tell the user how to
            view the copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if
            the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays such an
            announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an "About box",
            the Work is required to print or display the notice only under the same
            circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not
            normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print
            an announcement.);
        (iv)
            You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding
            machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily used
            for software interchange. The source code for a work means the
            preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
            executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all
            modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
            plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
            executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component that is
            normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
            components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
            which the executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of
            that component if you have it and are allowed to do so;
        (v) If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work,
            such material must include either a written copy of this License, or a
            prominent written indication that the Work is covered by this License
            and written instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the
            License on the distribution medium;
        (vi)
            You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise
            of the rights granted herein.
    .
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent
    ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to
    copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source code along
    with the object code.
    .
    3. Reservation of Rights.
    .
    No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein. You
    may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
    provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense
    or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
    you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    .
    4. Other Restrictions.
    .
    If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
    countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical
    distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
    permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
    License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    .
    5. Limitations.
    .
    THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
    THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
    AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
    AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
    YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    .
    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
    LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
    PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
    THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
    PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    .
    6. General.
    .
    This License is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A.,
    excluding choice of law rules.
    .
    If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that part
    shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law, and no
    other parts of the License shall be affected.
    .
    For United States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED
    RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States Government or are
    acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency, the following apply:
    .
        If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense ("DOD"), the Program and
        its documentation are classified as "commercial computer software" and
        "commercial computer software documentation" respectively and, pursuant to
        DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government is acquiring the Program and its
        documentation in accordance with the terms of this License. If the unit or
        agency is other than DOD, the Program and its documentation are classified
        as "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
        documentation" respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the
        Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance
        with the terms of this License.

License: LPPL-1.3+
    The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under
    which the the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.
    .
    You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright
    and which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly
    suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but
    it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is
    unrelated to TeX.
    .
    The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',
    below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors
    who are considering distributing their works under this license.
    .
    This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed
    and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of
    that work may be distributed.
    .
    We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you
    the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work
    that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
    maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of
    that work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while
    meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'
    and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.
    .
    .
    DEFINITIONS
    ===========
    .
    In this license document the following terms are used:
    .
       `Work'
        Any work being distributed under this License.
    .
       `Derived Work'
        Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.
    .
       `Modification'
        Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
        law -- for example, the production of a file containing an
        original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of
        such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
        translated into another language.
    .
       `Modify'
        To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
        applicable law.
    .
       `Distribution'
        Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in
        whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)
        making any electronic components of the Work accessible by
        file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file
        systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).
    .
       `Compiled Work'
        A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it
        is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may
        include using installation facilities provided by the Work,
        transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or
        other activities.  Note that modification of any installation
        facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.
    .
       `Current Maintainer'
        A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is
        no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under
        any applicable law.
    .
       `Base Interpreter'
        A program or process that is normally needed for running or
        interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.
    .
        A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these
        are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each
        external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used
        interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the
        license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a
        `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the
        `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.
    .
    .
    .
    CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    ===========================================
    .
    1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work
    are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In
    particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no
    requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.
    .
    2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you
    received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered
    modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived
    Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.
    .
    3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a
    complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2
    above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that
    the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly
    as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work
    directly from the Work.
    .
    4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without
    restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may
    also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including
    Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works
    distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to
    be updated versions of the Work.
    .
    5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify
    your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,
    and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on
    the Derived Work.
    .
    6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
    distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met
    for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states
    in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only
    the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption
    to a component of the Work.
    .
      a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement
         for a component of the Work when that component is used with the
         Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work
         identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that
         Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work
         clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version
         of this component to the user when used interactively with that
         Base Interpreter.
    .
      b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices
         detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a
         prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part
         of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log
         of the changes.
    .
      c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,
         including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version
         of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)
         the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the
         Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that
         they do provide such support for the Derived Work.
    .
      d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
    .
           1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work;
              if your distribution of a modified component is made by
              offering access to copy the modified component from a
              designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
              the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
              condition, even though third parties are not compelled to
              copy the Work along with the modified component;
    .
           2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,
              unmodified copy of the Work.
    .
    7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
    distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as
    the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled
    Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with
    regard to the Derived Work.
    .
    8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not
    apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it
    becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as
    it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.
    .
    9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative
    format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is
    then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or
    nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of
    applying that process.
    .
    10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license
           provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in
           Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have
           to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.
    .
        b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that
           Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of
           itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the
           restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.
    .
    11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to
    the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating
    such works with the Work by any means.
    .
    12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent
    complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.
    .
    .
    NO WARRANTY
    ===========
    .
    There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in
    writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without
    warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
    limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
    particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance
    of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume
    the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
    .
    In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
    will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the
    Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as
    permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,
    special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of
    the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited
    to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by
    anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other
    programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other
    party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    .
    .
    MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
    =======================
    .
    The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder
    explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in
    the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder
    or simply that it is `author-maintained'.
    .
    The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer
    who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error
    reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail
    address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge
    or act upon these error reports.
    .
    The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there
    is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current
    Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means
    of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other
    significant signs of active maintenance.
    .
    You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with
    any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.
    .
    If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of
    the Work through the following steps:
    .
     1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and
         the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of
         an Internet or similar search.
    .
     2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work
         is still maintained.
    .
      a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer
         to update their communication data within one month.
    .
      b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active
         maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce
         within the pertinent community your intention to take over
         maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be
         done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)
    .
     3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass
         maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect
         immediately upon announcement.
    .
      b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright
         Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,
         then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.
    .
     4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above
         and after three months your intention is challenged neither by
         the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other
         people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as
         to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.
    .
     5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes
         reachable once more within three months of a change completed
         under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must
         become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided
         they then update their communication data within one month.
    .
    A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact
    that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.
    .
    If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should
    immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous
    statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also
    announce your new status to the same pertinent community as
    in 2b) above.
    .
    .
    WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE
    ======================================================
    .
    This section contains important instructions, examples, and
    recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
    works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in
    this section.
    .
    Choosing This License or Another License
    ----------------------------------------
    .
    If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*
    conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then
    do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,
    distribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text
    of this license as a model for your own license, but your license
    should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that
    your work is distributed under the LPPL.
    .
    The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains
    the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,
    for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public
    License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is
    unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be
    relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any
    license are encouraged to read it.
    .
    A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
    -----------------------------------------------------
    .
    It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own
    personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for
    distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such
    modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by
    accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or
    it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified
    version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions
    of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,
    cause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your
    best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public
    one.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work
    without altering any of its licensed components.
    .
    How to Use This License
    -----------------------
    .
    To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both
    an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work
    was authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a
    statement that the distribution and/or modification of that
    component is constrained by the conditions in this license.
    .
    Here is an example of such a notice and statement:
    .
      %% pig.dtx
      %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
      %
      % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
      % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
      % of this license or (at your option) any later version.
      % The latest version of this license is in
      %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
      % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
      % version 2005/12/01 or later.
      %
      % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.
      %
      % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.
      %
      % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
      % and the derived file pig.sty.
    .
    Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions
    given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring
    to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being
    generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'
    referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and
    `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.
    .
    If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your
    Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.
    However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance
    section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to
    the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it
    yourself.
    .
    Derived Works That Are Not Replacements
    ---------------------------------------
    .
    Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and
    stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves
    with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a
    (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If
    this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a
    completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.
    .
    .
    Important Recommendations
    -------------------------
    .
     Defining What Constitutes the Work
    .
       The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the
       files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a
       way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.
       This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the
       files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by
       using a line such as:
    .
        % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.
    .
       in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
       impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you
       to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be
       entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise
       the Work.
