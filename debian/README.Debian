t1-urw-garamondno8 for Debian
-----------------------------

This package was created from the original file located at
ftp://dante.ctan.org/tex-archive/nonfree/fonts/urw/garamond.zip

The original zip file contains two other zip files. Both were extracted
and a single gzip'ed tar file was created for the Debian archive.
